# Contributing guide

## Code standards
To be specified later. Just write clean code for now.

## How to contribute

### If doing this for the first time
1. Fork this repo.
2. **Clone your fork** on your computer.

### Every time
0. Be sure to always work with the current upstream master.
1. Create a **feature branch** for your changes. This is important - don't push to master!

    ```
    git checkout -b new-feature
    ```
    
    Also, do a special branch for **each feature** you want to implement - don't put multiple features into one branch - this is also very important!
2. Push this new branch into your fork upstream.
3. Open a pull request.
4. Wait for the PR to be accepted / cooperate with the developers to achieve this.
5. Enjoy having helped bunch of other users enjoying your changes :-) Thank you!

## Notes
- After you're done with improving your PR by pushing more commits into the feature branch that still covers the one thing, your commits may be _squashed_ to keep the history clean in the main repo.
- If having any doubts, don't hesitate to contact us.
